*   Other folder files: 1 to 1
*   Images naming: no uppercase

### * Command Line

*   `dotnet restore`

### * App Specific: CERS

*   `App.xaml.cs` file. The problem is on line 48 where `Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` is being used, which is deprecated in .NET MAUI. This should be replaced with `MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread`.

### * `F10` `App.cs`

*   Create window

### * Update MAUI Project File with Necessary Dependencies and Configurations

#### * App Specific: CERS

```xml
<!--  update the MauiProgram.cs file to register the SQLite service with dependency injection -->
        <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
        <PackageReference Include="sqlite-net-pcl" Version="1.8.116" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Essentials" Version="$(MauiVersion)" />
```

### * Remove Xamarin Imports with MAUI Equivalent

*   `using System.Reflection.Emit;` --> `""` (remove)
*   `Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` --> `MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread`
*   `Color.FromHex` --> `Color.FromArgb`
*   `using System.Web;` --> `using System.Net;`

*   Fix the `HttpUtility.UrlEncode` calls since we removed the `System.Web` reference. Let me replace them with the .NET equivalent:
*   Replace all the `HttpUtility.UrlEncode` calls with `WebUtility.UrlEncode` in the `HitServices.cs` file.

#### * Summary of Changes Made

1.  **Fixed `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` version downgrade warning**
    *   Updated the package reference from version `8.0.91` to `8.0.100` in `CERS.csproj` to match the version required by other MAUI components.
2.  **Resolved `System.Web.HttpUtility` package reference issue**
    *   Removed the `System.Web.HttpUtility` package reference (which doesn't exist for .NET MAUI).
    *   Replaced `using System.Web;` with `using System.Net;` in both `App.xaml.cs` and `HitServices.cs`.
    *   Updated all `HttpUtility.UrlEncode()` calls to use `WebUtility.UrlEncode()` instead.
3.  **Fixed `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` namespace reference errors**
    *   The `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` using statement is now properly resolved with the correct package version.
    *   All Essentials APIs like `Preferences`, `MainThread`, and `Connectivity` should now work correctly.

### * Fix `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` Namespace Issues

*   `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Essentials" Version="8.0.91" />`

### * Fix Duplicate `App` Class Definitions

### * Fix `Label` Ambiguous Reference

### * Fix `Color` Property Issues

### * Fix Duplicate XAML Attributes

### * Fix the Remaining `Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` Calls to Use the MAUI Equivalent `MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread`. Let Me Update These:

### * Update Any Remaining Xamarin References in Your Code Files

Your project should now compile successfully! The key changes ensure:

*   ✅ All dependencies are properly configured
*   ✅ Platform-specific SQLite implementations work with MAUI's dependency injection
*   ✅ Color and threading APIs use MAUI equivalents
*   ✅ Namespace references are updated for MAUI

### * Don't Override Files

1.  Resolve `System.Web.HttpUtility` package reference issue
2.  Fix `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` version downgrade warning
3.  Fix `'Microsoft.Maui.Essentials'` namespace reference errors

*   ! The code is using `Preferences`, `MainThread`, and `Connectivity` from `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials`, but the namespace reference is incorrect. In .NET MAUI, these are now in separate namespaces. Let me fix this:
*   Use `using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;`

### * Hotkey

*   `ctrl+shift+c` (with all row)

*   `Font` property is deprecated in .NET MAUI. It should be replaced with `FontSize`. Let me fix this:

*   The problem is that in .NET 8 MAUI, the `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` namespace doesn't exist as a separate namespace anymore. The Essentials APIs are now directly available in the main MAUI namespaces.

*   **Severity Code Description Project File Line Source**
    Error (active) XFC0009 No property, BindableProperty, or event found for "Font", or mismatching type between value and property. CERS (net8.0-android), CERS (net8.0-ios), CERS (net8.0-maccatalyst), CERS (net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0) C:\Users\Parth\Desktop\2025\CERS-baseone\CERS\ViewExpenditureDetailsPage.xaml 100 Build

*   **What You Should NOT Copy:**
    *   `MainActivity.cs` - MAUI uses a different base class and simplified approach
    *   Most Resources - MAUI handles resources differently through the main project
    *   `Android_SQLite.cs` - Already converted to `MauiSQLite.cs` with proper MAUI patterns

*   I found the issue! The problem is that your database classes are using `DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>()` (Xamarin.Forms pattern) but you've registered the service using MAUI's dependency injection (`builder.Services.AddSingleton`). These two systems don't work together.

*   Remove all Xamarin patterns

*   The error has changed - now it's a `TypeInitializationException` for the `CERS.App` class, which means there's an exception being thrown during static field initialization in your `App` class.

*   I found the issue! The problem is in the static field initialization in your `App` class. Lines 23, 26, and 28 are creating database instances as static fields:

    ```csharp
    public static UserDetailsDatabase userDetailsDatabase = new UserDetailsDatabase();
    public static SavePreferenceDatabase savePreferenceDatabase = new SavePreferenceDatabase();
    public static LanguageMasterDatabase languageMasterDatabase = new LanguageMasterDat
    ```

*   These database constructors are trying to use `DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>()` before the MAUI application has fully initialized, causing the crash.

*   When the `UserDetailsDatabase` constructor ran, it tried to call `DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>()`, but the service wasn't registered yet.

*   **Moved database initialization to the constructor:**
    *   Changed static fields to declarations only (no initialization)
    *   Added database instance creation in the `App()` constructor after `InitializeComponent()`
    *   This ensures databases are created after MAUI's dependency injection is fully initialized

*   The app should now start successfully without the `TypeInitializationException`. The database instances will be created at the right time when the dependency service is available.

*   The error is a XAML parsing issue: Cannot convert "Default" into `Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color` at position 24:10 in your `App.xaml` file.

*   I found the issue! On line 24, you have `<Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Default</Color>`. The value "Default" is not a valid color in .NET MAUI.

#### * `App.xaml`

*   **Changed line 24 in `App.xaml`:**
    *   From: `<Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Default</Color>`
    *   To: `<Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Transparent</Color>`
*   The app should now start successfully without the XAML parsing exception. The `Transparent` color is a valid color value that will work properly with your frame styling.

### * Fix `SQLitePCLRaw.provider.dynamic_cdecl` Assembly Loading Issue

#### * Fix Applied

*   **Added to `CERS.csproj`:**
    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green" Version="2.1.6" />
    ```

### * Key Differences (Xamarin.Forms vs. .NET MAUI)

The code worked in Xamarin.Forms because Xamarin.Forms had a different initialization sequence and dependency resolution system.

#### * Xamarin.Forms:
*   `DependencyService` was initialized early in the application lifecycle
*   Static field initialization happened after the dependency service was ready
*   The `[assembly: Dependency(typeof(Android_SQLite))]` attribute registered services at compile time
*   Platform-specific implementations were available immediately

#### * .NET MAUI:
*   Uses Microsoft's dependency injection container which initializes later
*   Static fields are initialized when the type is first accessed (before MAUI startup)
*   Services are registered in `MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp()` which runs after static initialization
*   There's a timing mismatch between when static fields initialize and when services become available

#### * Why the Timing Issue Exists:
*   Static field initialization happens when the `App` class is first referenced
*   MAUI dependency injection setup happens in `MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp()`
*   App constructor runs after DI is configured
*   In Xamarin.Forms, the `DependencyService` was a simpler, earlier-initialized system that was available during static field initialization. MAUI's more sophisticated DI container requires the full application context to be set up first.

*   That's why moving the database initialization from static fields to the constructor fixed the issue - it ensures the database objects are created after MAUI's dependency injection system is fully initialized and the services are available.

### * In `App.xaml.cs` Define `DB_NAME = "CERS.db "`

*   `var databasePath = Path.Combine(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory, "CERS.db");`
    *   **to** `var databasePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData), ResillentConstruction.App.DB_Name);`

### * Open Old and New Reference Code in `agneticApp`

### * Find Database Tables and Check What Mobile Numbers Exist for Login Testing

Based on the code analysis, the login system works by calling a web API to check user types and authenticate users. The app doesn't store test mobile numbers locally - it validates them against a remote server.

#### * How the Login System Works:
*   User enters mobile number → App calls `CheckUserType_Get(mobileNo)` API
*   API returns user type → "Candidate", "Agent", or "Observor"
*   App calls appropriate login API → `userlogin_Get()` or `observorlogin_Get()`
*   If user exists → App calls `GetOtp()` to send OTP
*   User enters OTP → App calls `checkotp_Get()` to verify

#### * To Test Login:
Since this connects to a live API server, you need actual registered mobile numbers from the CERS system database. The app doesn't have hardcoded test numbers.

#### * Options:
*   Check with system admin for test mobile numbers
*   Look at API documentation for test credentials
*   Check server logs for existing registered numbers
*   Create test data through the web admin panel (if available)

#### * The mobile number validation requires:
*   10 digits
*   Must start with 6, 7, 8, or 9
*   Only numeric characters
*   Without access to the server database or test credentials, you'll need to contact the system administrator to get valid mobile numbers for testing the login functionality.

### * Find the Database Connection URL/Base URL in the Code to Help User Connect to Database

*   `baseurl = "http://10.146.2.8/CERSWebApi/"`

### * Create Mock/Fake API Responses to Bypass Network Calls for Testing
