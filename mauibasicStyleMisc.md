I'll examine the XAML file to understand why the label and value are overlapping in the "Enter Response" section shown in your image.

Looking at the XAML file, I can see the issue with the overlapping label and value. The problem is in the grid structure around lines 200-212. Let me analyze the specific area:

The `lbl_remarks` label is placed at `Grid.Row="23"` (lines 200-204), but the corresponding `entry_remarks` Editor is placed at `Grid.Row="24"` (lines 205-212). However, looking at the main grid definition on line 36, I can see that the grid only has 22 rows defined:

```xml
<Grid RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto" RowSpacing="8">
```

This means:
- Row 0 through Row 21 are properly defined (22 rows total)
- Row 22 is the last valid row
- Row 23 and Row 24 don't exist in the grid definition

When you try to place elements in rows that don't exist (Row 23 and Row 24), MAUI/Xamarin will likely place them in the last available row (Row 21 or create overlapping behavior), causing the label and input field to overlap.

**The solution is to add more row definitions to the grid.** You need to add at least 3 more "Auto" entries to the RowDefinitions to accommodate rows 22, 23, and 24.

Perfect! I've fixed the issue by adding 4 more "Auto" entries to the RowDefinitions. Now the grid has 26 rows (0-25) instead of the original 22 rows (0-21).

## Summary

The overlapping issue was caused by **insufficient row definitions in the main Grid**. Here's what was happening:

1. **Original problem**: The Grid only had 22 row definitions (rows 0-21), but you were trying to place:
   - `lbl_remarks` at `Grid.Row="23"` 
   - `entry_remarks` at `Grid.Row="24"`

2. **Root cause**: When you reference grid rows that don't exist in the RowDefinitions, the layout engine doesn't know how to properly position the elements, causing them to overlap or be placed incorrectly.

3. **Solution**: I added 4 more "Auto" entries to the RowDefinitions, expanding it from 22 rows to 26 rows. Now:
   - Row 23 exists for `lbl_remarks` 
   - Row 24 exists for `entry_remarks`
   - Row 25 exists for the file upload section
   - Plus one extra row for future use

The "Enter Response" field (which appears to be the remarks field based on your image) should now display properly with the label above and the input field below, without any overlapping.
