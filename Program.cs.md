Let me read the Program.cs file first to provide the context-specific explanation:

Now let me provide the context-specific explanation for [Program.cs](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/Personl/MAUIAPP/CameraApk/MauiProgram.cs:0:0-0:0):

```csharp
using ObjCRuntime;
// In THIS context: Import needed for iOS Objective-C runtime integration
// - ObjCRuntime: Contains types for bridging between C# and iOS Objective-C runtime
// - Required for low-level iOS application startup and runtime interop

using UIKit;
// In THIS context: Import needed specifically for UIApplication.Main() method
// - UIKit: Apple's user interface framework containing UIApplication class
// - UIApplication: iOS class that manages the application's main event loop

namespace CameraApk
// In THIS context: Same namespace as main app so iOS entry point integrates with shared code
{
    public class Program
    // In THIS context: The very first entry point when CameraApk launches on iOS
    // - public: iOS system needs to access this class to start the application
    // - class Program: Standard .NET naming convention for application entry point
    // - This is the iOS equivalent of a console app's Program.Main()
    {
        // This is the main entry point of the application.
        // In THIS context: Comment explaining this is where iOS app execution begins
        
        static void Main(string[] args)
        // In THIS context: The actual method iOS calls when CameraApk process starts
        // - static: No instance needed - this is a utility method for app startup
        // - void: Doesn't return anything - just starts the iOS application
        // - Main: Standard .NET entry point method name
        // - string[] args: Command line arguments (rarely used on iOS)
        {
            // if you want to use a different Application Delegate class from "AppDelegate"
            // you can specify it here.
            // In THIS context: Comment explaining how to customize the AppDelegate class
            
            UIApplication.Main(args, null, typeof(AppDelegate));
            // In THIS context: Starts the iOS application with specified AppDelegate
            // - UIApplication.Main(): iOS method that initializes and runs the app
            // - args: Passes command line arguments to iOS application
            // - null: No custom UIApplication subclass (uses default)
            // - typeof(AppDelegate): Tells iOS to use our AppDelegate.cs as the application delegate
            // - This method transfers control from Program.cs to AppDelegate.cs
            // - After this call, AppDelegate.CreateMauiApp() will be called
        }
    }
}
```

**Key contextual purposes:**

- **`using ObjCRuntime`**: In THIS context, needed for iOS runtime integration and Objective-C bridging
- **`using UIKit`**: In THIS context, specifically needed for [UIApplication.Main()](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/Personl/MAUIAPP/CameraApk/Platforms/iOS/Program.cs:7:8-13:9) method that starts iOS apps
- **`public class Program`**: In THIS context, it's the very first class that executes when CameraApk launches on iOS
- **`static void Main(string[] args)`**: In THIS context, it's the iOS entry point method (like console apps, but for iOS)
- **[UIApplication.Main(args, null, typeof(AppDelegate))](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/Personl/MAUIAPP/CameraApk/Platforms/iOS/Program.cs:7:8-13:9)**: In THIS context, it starts the iOS application and hands control to AppDelegate.cs
- **`typeof(AppDelegate)`**: In THIS context, it tells iOS which class to use as the application delegate

The entire file's purpose: Serve as the absolute first entry point when CameraApk launches on iOS, then immediately transfer control to the AppDelegate.

**Platform-specific context**: This file only exists for iOS builds - Android doesn't need this because Android uses a different application startup model.

**iOS-specific context**:
- **Program.Main()**: iOS apps need a .NET-style entry point before transitioning to iOS AppDelegate pattern
- **UIApplication.Main()**: Apple's method that starts the iOS application event loop and lifecycle
- **typeof(AppDelegate)**: Connects this entry point to the AppDelegate.cs file

**Execution flow context**:
1. **Program.cs**: iOS starts here (first code that runs)
2. **UIApplication.Main()**: Transfers to iOS application system
3. **AppDelegate.cs**: iOS creates AppDelegate and calls CreateMauiApp()
4. **MauiProgram.cs**: AppDelegate calls this to create the MAUI app
5. **App.xaml.cs**: MAUI creates App class and shows MainPage

This is the iOS-specific bootstrap that gets the MAUI framework running on Apple devices.
