# Natural Language Requirements: TmpPage.cs (Complete Breakdown)

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Import Required Namespace

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
At the top of the C# code-behind file, import Microsoft.Maui.Controls namespace to access MAUI controls and page classes like ContentPage, DisplayAlert, Navigation, PhoneDialer, Browser, and Email. This namespace provides all the essential classes and methods needed for implementing page functionality and user interactions.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Define Namespace and Partial Class Declaration

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create a namespace named NICVC to match the project structure and organize the code. Inside the namespace, declare a partial class named TmpPage that inherits from ContentPage. The partial keyword is required because this class is split between the XAML file (which defines the UI structure) and this C# file (which contains the logic and event handlers). Inheriting from ContentPage makes this a MAUI page that can be navigated to and displayed in the app.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
namespace NICVC
{
    public partial class TmpPage : ContentPage
    {
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Initialize Page Components in Constructor

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create a constructor method with the same name as the class (AboutUsPage in the current file - NOTE: This should be TmpPage to match the class name). Inside the constructor, call InitializeComponent() which is an auto-generated method by MAUI that connects all the XAML UI elements (labels, buttons, images) defined in TmpPage.xaml to this code-behind class. This method must be called before accessing any UI elements. Without this call, all UI elements will be null and the page will not render properly.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        public AboutUsPage()  // NOTE: Should be TmpPage() to match class name
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Handle "Call Us" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Deptt_Call that is triggered when the user taps the "Call Us" row in the UI. This method receives two parameters: sender (the UI element that raised the event) and e (event arguments containing event data). Inside this method, implement the logic to open the device's phone dialer with the department's phone number pre-filled. Use MAUI's PhoneDialer.Open() API to launch the dialer. Wrap the implementation in a try-catch block to handle errors such as devices without phone capability or invalid phone numbers.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Deptt_Call(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle call action
            // TODO: Implement PhoneDialer.Open("+91xxxxxxxxxx");
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Handle "Website" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Deptt_WebSite that is triggered when the user taps the "Website" row. Mark the method as async because opening a browser is an asynchronous operation. Inside this method, implement logic to open the department's website URL in the device's default browser. Use MAUI's Browser.OpenAsync() API with the website URL and BrowserLaunchMode.SystemPreferred to launch the browser. Wrap the implementation in a try-catch block to handle errors such as no internet connection or invalid URLs.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Deptt_WebSite(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle website navigation
            // TODO: Implement await Browser.OpenAsync("https://www.nic.in", BrowserLaunchMode.SystemPreferred);
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Handle "Email" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Deptt_Email that is triggered when the user taps the "Email" row. Mark the method as async because composing an email is an asynchronous operation. Inside this method, create an EmailMessage object with properties for To (recipient email address), Subject (email subject line), and Body (email content). Use MAUI's Email.ComposeAsync() API to open the device's email app with the message pre-filled. Wrap the implementation in a try-catch block to handle errors such as no email app configured on the device.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Deptt_Email(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle email action
            // TODO: Implement Email.ComposeAsync with department email
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Handle "Preferences" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Preferences that is triggered when the user taps the "Preferences" row. Mark the method as async because navigation is an asynchronous operation. Inside this method, implement navigation to the app's preferences or settings page using Navigation.PushAsync() to push the PreferencesPage onto the navigation stack. This allows users to go back using the back button. Wrap the implementation in a try-catch block to handle navigation errors.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Preferences(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle preferences navigation
            // TODO: Implement await Navigation.PushAsync(new PreferencesPage());
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Handle "Update Personal Info" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named PersonalInfo_Tapped that is triggered when the user taps the "Update Personal Info" row. Mark the method as async for navigation operations. Inside this method, implement navigation to the personal information edit page where users can update their profile details like name, email, phone number, and address. Use Navigation.PushAsync() to navigate to PersonalInfoPage. Wrap the implementation in a try-catch block to handle navigation errors.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void PersonalInfo_Tapped(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle personal info update
            // TODO: Implement await Navigation.PushAsync(new PersonalInfoPage());
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Handle "Delete Profile" Tap Event (Destructive Action)

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named DeleteProfile_Tapped that is triggered when the user taps the "Delete Profile" row. Mark the method as async for dialog and navigation operations. Inside this method, first show a confirmation dialog using DisplayAlert() with "Yes, Delete" and "Cancel" buttons to warn the user about the permanent nature of this action. If the user confirms, implement profile deletion logic which includes calling a backend API to delete the account from the server, clearing all local data using Preferences.Clear() and SecureStorage.RemoveAll() to remove saved credentials and settings, and navigating to the login page. Wrap all logic in a try-catch block to handle errors during the deletion process.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void DeleteProfile_Tapped(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle profile deletion
            // TODO: Show confirmation dialog, then clear data and navigate to login
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Handle "Logout" Tap Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Logout that is triggered when the user taps the "Logout" row. Mark the method as async for dialog and navigation operations. Inside this method, show a confirmation dialog using DisplayAlert() with "Logout" and "Cancel" buttons to confirm the user wants to logout. If confirmed, clear the user's session data by removing items from Preferences (like IsLoggedIn, UserId, UserToken) and SecureStorage (like AuthToken). Optionally call a logout API endpoint to invalidate the session on the server. Finally, navigate to the login page by setting Application.Current.MainPage to a new NavigationPage containing LoginPage. Wrap all logic in a try-catch block to handle errors during logout.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Logout(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Handle logout
            // TODO: Show confirmation, clear session data, navigate to login
        }
```

## ‚úÖ 11. Handle Modal Close Button Click Event

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Create an event handler method named Btn_CloseThisHelp_Clicked that is triggered when the user clicks the "Continue to Logout" button in the modal popup overlay. Inside this method, find the ContentView element that represents the modal by searching through the Grid's Children collection. When found, set its IsVisible property to false to hide the modal overlay and return the user to the underlying page content. After closing the modal, call the Logout() method to proceed with the actual logout process. Wrap the logic in a try-catch block to handle errors during modal manipulation.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
        private void Btn_CloseThisHelp_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Close modal
            // TODO: Find ContentView modal, set IsVisible=false, then call Logout()
        }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 12. Close Class and Namespace

### **Natural-Language Instruction Breakdown**
Close the TmpPage class definition with a closing curly brace. Then close the NICVC namespace definition with another closing curly brace. This completes the file structure.

### **The C# Code-Behind Logic (TmpPage.cs)**
```csharp
    }
}
```
