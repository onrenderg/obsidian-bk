## ü•ú **In a Nutshell - The Navigation Issue:**

### **The Problem:**
**"Failed to navigate value cannot be null parameter view"** Android runtime crash

### **The Root Cause:**
**ONE problematic XAML element in [FlyoutMenuPage.xaml](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/tmp/x10card-maui-base/NewUserRegistration/FlyoutMenuPage.xaml:0:0-0:0):**

```xml
<!-- THIS caused the crash: -->
<FormattedString>
    <Span x:Name="lbl_username" TextColor="#078ff0" />
</FormattedString>
```

### **Why It Failed:**
- **Named Span inside FormattedString** doesn't work properly in .NET MAUI
- **XAML parser couldn't handle** the complex text formatting structure
- **Android runtime crashed** before any C# code could even run
- **The crash happened during XAML initialization**, not during navigation logic

### **The Misleading Part:**
- ‚ùå **Navigation code was fine** (`mainWindow.Page = ...`)
- ‚ùå **FlyoutPage structure was fine**
- ‚ùå **PersonalDetailsPage was fine**
- ‚ùå **All C# logic was fine**

### **The Simple Fix:**
**Replace complex XAML with simple XAML:**
```xml
<!-- BEFORE (crashed): -->
<FormattedString>
    <Span x:Name="lbl_username" ... />
</FormattedString>

<!-- AFTER (works): -->
<Label x:Name="lbl_username" Text="User" ... />
```

### **The Lesson:**
**One bad XAML element = entire app crash**
- The error message was misleading (said "navigation" but was actually "XAML parsing")
- Complex Xamarin.Forms XAML doesn't always work the same in .NET MAUI
- Always test XAML elements individually when porting

**Bottom line: It wasn't a navigation issue at all - it was a XAML compatibility issue!** üéØ
