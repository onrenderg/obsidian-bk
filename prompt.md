## Breakdown of [mobile_bearer_token_get.sql](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/sep15/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS-basetwo-git/stored-procedures-CERSWebApi/mobile_bearer_token_get.sql:0:0-0:0) Procedure

This stored procedure is designed to generate a secure, random 32-character bearer token, store it in the database, and return it along with a status message.

### 1. Procedure Definition and Output Parameters

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [sec].[mobile_bearer_token_get]
    @status_code int = 0 OUTPUT,
    @status_message varchar(200) = '' OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   `CREATE PROCEDURE`: This command creates a new stored procedure named `mobile_bearer_token_get` within the `sec` schema.
    *   `@status_code int = 0 OUTPUT`: This declares an **output parameter** named `@status_code`. It's a whole number (`int`) used to send a status code (like 200 for success or 400 for failure) back to the application that called the procedure.
    *   `@status_message varchar(200) = '' OUTPUT`: This declares another **output parameter** to send a descriptive message (like 'Created' or 'Token Generation Failed') back to the application.
    *   `BEGIN`: Marks the start of the procedure's code block.

### 2. Variable Declarations

```sql
    DECLARE @char_set VARCHAR(75) = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';
    DECLARE @Length INT = 32;
    DECLARE @token_id VARCHAR(32) = '';
    DECLARE @i INT = 1;
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   `DECLARE @char_set`: Creates a "box" (variable) to hold all the possible characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers) that can be used to generate the token.
    *   `DECLARE @Length`: Sets the desired length of the token to 32 characters.
    *   `DECLARE @token_id`: Creates an empty text variable that will be used to build the new token, character by character.
    *   `DECLARE @i`: Creates a counter variable, which will be used to make sure the generation loop runs exactly 32 times.

### 3. Token Generation Loop

```sql
    WHILE @i <= @Length
    BEGIN
        SET @token_id = @token_id + SUBSTRING(@char_set, ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % LEN(@char_set) + 1, 1);
        SET @i = @i + 1;
    END
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   `WHILE @i <= @Length`: This starts a loop that will continue to run as long as the counter `@i` is less than or equal to 32.
    *   `SET @token_id = @token_id + ...`: This is the core of the random generation. In each loop:
        1.  `NEWID()`: Generates a unique random ID.
        2.  `CHECKSUM()`: Converts that ID into a random number.
        3.  `ABS()`: Ensures the number is positive.
        4.  `% LEN(@char_set)`: Uses the modulo operator to get a random position within the length of our character set (a number between 0 and 61).
        5.  `+ 1`: Adds one to make the position between 1 and 62.
        6.  `SUBSTRING(...)`: Picks out the single character at that random position from `@char_set`.
        7.  `@token_id + ...`: Adds the newly picked random character to the end of our `@token_id` string.
    *   `SET @i = @i + 1`: Increases the counter by one, so the loop eventually ends after 32 cycles.

### 4. Cleanup of Expired Tokens

```sql
    delete from secExpense.[sec].[mobile_token_master] where expire_datetime < GETDATE();
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   This is a maintenance step. Before adding the new token, it cleans up the `mobile_token_master` table by removing any old tokens that are past their expiration date (`expire_datetime`). This keeps the table efficient and secure.

### 5. Storing the New Token

```sql
    insert into secExpense.[sec].[mobile_token_master] (token_id) values (@token_id);
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   This command takes the newly generated 32-character random string from the `@token_id` variable and saves it into the `mobile_token_master` table. This is how the system remembers which tokens are valid.

### 6. Success or Failure Check

```sql
    if @@ROWCOUNT > 0
    BEGIN		
        Select @status_code = 200;
        Select @status_message = 'Created';	  
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        Select '' token_id;
        Select @status_code = 400;
        Select @status_message = 'Token Generation Failed';
    END
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   `if @@ROWCOUNT > 0`: `@@ROWCOUNT` is a special system variable that holds the number of rows affected by the last command. This line checks if the `insert` command successfully added one row.
    *   `BEGIN ... END`: If the insert was successful (`@@ROWCOUNT` is 1), it sets the output parameters to indicate success (`@status_code = 200`, `@status_message = 'Created'`).
    *   `ELSE ... END`: If the insert failed for some reason (`@@ROWCOUNT` is 0), it sets the output parameters to indicate failure (`@status_code = 400`, `@status_message = 'Token Generation Failed'`).

### 7. Returning the Final Result

```sql
    Select @token_id token_id, @status_code status_code, @status_message status_message;
END
```
*   **Purpose:**
    *   `Select ...`: This is the final output of the procedure. It returns a single row containing the newly generated token, the final status code, and the final status message. The application that called this procedure will receive this data.
    *   `END`: Marks the end of the procedure's code.
