Of course. I understand you want a prompt that you can use to instruct an AI to perform the conversion from `StackLayout` to `Grid` on a file-by-file basis.

Here is a detailed prompt you can use. Simply provide the content of your XAML file after this prompt.

### AI Prompt for XAML Refactoring

**Your Role:** You are an expert .NET MAUI developer specializing in UI performance optimization.

**Your Task:** Your task is to refactor the provided XAML file. You must convert all `StackLayout`-based layouts to use the `Grid` layout system to improve performance and maintainability, while ensuring the user interface looks exactly the same.

**Conversion Rules:**

1.  **Replace `StackLayout` with `Grid`:** Replace every `<StackLayout>` element with a `<Grid>`.
2.  **Handle Vertical Orientation:** For each `<StackLayout Orientation="Vertical">` (or any `StackLayout` without a specified `Orientation`), create `<Grid.RowDefinitions>`. Each direct child element from the original `StackLayout` should be placed in its own row. Assign the `Grid.Row` property to each child, starting from `0`.
3.  **Handle Horizontal Orientation:** For each `<StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal">`, create `<Grid.ColumnDefinitions>`. Each direct child element from the original `StackLayout` should be placed in its own column. Assign the `Grid.Column` property to each child, starting from `0`.
4.  **Remove `*AndExpand` Options:** You must remove all `*AndExpand` layout options from `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions`. This is critical.
    *   `FillAndExpand` should be removed. The `Grid`'s proportional sizing (e.g., `<RowDefinition Height="*"/>` or `<ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>`) handles expansion.
    *   `CenterAndExpand`, `StartAndExpand`, and `EndAndExpand` should be converted to `Center`, `Start`, and `End` respectively.
5.  **Preserve Attributes:** All other attributes must be preserved on their original elements. This includes `x:Name`, `Style`, `Padding`, `Margin`, `FontSize`, event handlers (like `Clicked` or `Tapped`), and `GestureRecognizers`.
6.  **Maintain Visual Layout:** The final XAML must produce the same visual layout as the original. The structure, spacing, and alignment of all UI elements must be identical.

**Input:** I will provide the full content of a single [.xaml](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/sep15/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS/MorePage.xaml:0:0-0:0) file.

**Output:** You must return only the complete, refactored XAML code for the file. Do not include any explanations or apologies.

You can now copy and paste this prompt, and then paste the content of [MorePage.xaml](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/sep15/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS/MorePage.xaml:0:0-0:0), [AddExpenditureDetailsPage.xaml](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/sep15/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS-basetwo-git/CERS/AddExpenditureDetailsPage.xaml:0:0-0:0), or any other file you wish to convert right after it. Let me know if you need prompts for any other tasks
