I can see what happened! You successfully linked the observer to the candidate's expenditure data. Let me explain the flow:

## **What You Did:**

1. **Found expenditure record** in `secExpense.sec.candidateRegister`:
   - `ExpenseID: 30064`
   - `AutoID: 344513` (This is the candidate's unique ID)
   - `PanchayatCode: 1301001018`
   - `ExpStatus: F` (Final submitted)

2. **Updated ObserverMapping table**:
   - Set `PanchayatWardCode = 1301001018` for observer `9418011750`

3. **Tested observer login**: `exec sec.Mobile_CERS_ObservorLogin '9418011750'`
   - Result: Observer "Sh. Mast Ram" can now access this area

4. **Retrieved candidate data**: `exec [sec].[Mobile_getobserver_candidates] '1301001018'`
   - Result: Shows candidate `AutoID: 344513`, Name: "रेखा देवी", Amount: `1311552.00`

## **How AUTO_ID 344513 and रेखा देवी Appeared:**

The connection happened through this flow:

1. **PanchayatCode `1301001018`** links the expenditure record to a specific area
2. **AutoID `344513`** in the expenditure table corresponds to a candidate in `CandidatePersonalInfo`
3. **Observer procedure** `Mobile_getobserver_candidates` queries candidates by PanchayatCode
4. It finds candidate with `AUTO_ID = 344513` whose name is **"रेखा देवी"**
5. The **Amount `1311552.00`** is the total expenditure amount for this candidate

## **The Database Relationship:**

```
candidateRegister (expenditures)     CandidatePersonalInfo (candidates)
├── AutoID: 344513              ←→   ├── AUTO_ID: 344513  
├── PanchayatCode: 1301001018        ├── VOTER_NAME: रेखा देवी
├── amount: 121212.00                └── CONSTITUENCY_CODE: 1301001018
└── ExpStatus: F                     

ObserverMapping (observer assignments)
├── PanchayatWardCode: 1301001018  ←→  Links observer to this area
└── ObserverContact: 9418011750
```

So **रेखा देवी** (AUTO_ID: 344513) is the candidate whose expenditure you were looking at, and the observer can now see her expenditure data because you mapped the observer to her panchayat area (`1301001018`).
