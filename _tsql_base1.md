I'll create a new practice notebook focused on step-by-step SQL clauses based on the mobile bearer token SQL file. Let me first examine the reference file to understand the concepts.

Now I'll create a step-by-step practice notebook focusing on the SQL clauses and concepts from this mobile bearer token procedure:



Perfect! I've created a step-by-step SQL clauses practice notebook ([sql-clauses-step-by-step.ipynb](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/sep15/md-webapp-csharp-sql-pract/mssql-sql/sql-clauses-step-by-step.ipynb:0:0-0:0)) based on the mobile bearer token procedure. Here's what I've built:

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step SQL Clauses Coverage:**

### **Step 1: OUTPUT Parameters**
- Basic OUTPUT parameter syntax
- How to return values from procedures
- Testing OUTPUT parameters with DECLARE

### **Step 2: DECLARE Variables**
- Multiple variable declarations
- Variable initialization with default values
- Working with different data types

### **Step 3: WHILE Loop**
- Simple iteration examples
- Token generation using WHILE loop
- String manipulation with SUBSTRING and NEWID()

### **Step 4: DELETE Clause**
- DELETE with WHERE conditions
- Working with date comparisons (GETDATE())
- Cleaning up expired records

### **Step 5: INSERT Clause**
- Basic INSERT syntax
- Using @@ROWCOUNT to check success
- Working with temporary tables

### **Step 6: IF-ELSE Control Flow**
- Conditional logic implementation
- @@ROWCOUNT validation
- Success/failure handling

### **Step 7: SELECT Clause**
- Returning multiple values
- Variable output formatting
- Result set generation

### **Step 8: Complete Integration**
- Full token generation procedure
- All clauses working together
- Real-world implementation example

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features:**
- **Minimal theory** - focused on practical implementation
- **Step-by-step progression** - each concept builds on the previous
- **Executable examples** - all code can be run independently
- **Practice exercises** - hands-on challenges
- **Clause execution order** - logical flow understanding

## ðŸ”§ **Concepts from Mobile Bearer Token Procedure:**
- Random token generation using `NEWID()` and `CHECKSUM()`
- Character set manipulation with `SUBSTRING()`
- Loop-based string building
- Conditional success/failure handling
- OUTPUT parameter usage for status reporting

The notebook follows a progressive learning approach where each step introduces one SQL clause concept, making it easy to understand and practice individual components before combining them into a complete procedure!
