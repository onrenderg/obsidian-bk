# Removed style from Style.xaml but still referenced in pages 

## Example add those styles and colors if they're being referenced in your app. Let me check which ones are actually being used:





removed the LabelStyle_TabMenu style from 
Styles.xaml
, but it's still being referenced in your pages (like 
DashboardPage.xaml
 line 215, 223, 231). You need to add it back:


# Colors.xaml the keys were auto-corrected to lowercase (e.g., Light_Lbl_text_Color instead of Light_Lbl_Text_Color). Let me fix the casing:

## issue - the keys have incorrect casing (lowercase instead of uppercase).



You're right! The NavigationPage style already handles the navigation bar, but it only sets BarTextColor which applies to the default navigation title, not custom TitleView content.

Since you're using custom NavigationPage.TitleView with labels in it, those labels need their own style (which is why I created NavigationHeaderStyle).

However, if you want to simplify and have the NavigationPage style also work for labels inside TitleView, you can't do that directly. The NavigationPage.BarTextColor only affects the built-in title text, not custom XAML content.

Two approaches:

Keep NavigationHeaderStyle (current approach) - Explicit style for labels in custom TitleViews
Use implicit Label style - Make all labels in TitleView white by default
If you want option 2, I can modify the implicit Label style to check if it's in a navigation context. But the cleaner approach is what we have now - a dedicated NavigationHeaderStyle that you apply to navigation labels.

The NavigationPage style is working correctly - it sets the navigation bar background to Primary (DeepSkyBlue) and the bar text/icons to white. The NavigationHeaderStyle is needed specifically for the custom labels you're placing inside NavigationPage.TitleView.

Does this make sense, or would you like me to try a different approach?
